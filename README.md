# Posture_Detection_using_YOLO
It's a real-time detection project based on posture detection using YOLO with the help of your webcam.

I plan to make this project even better using some sort of pose detection algorithm so that it doesn't require the entire subject to be inside the camera range.
OR even better I would like to use some sort of sensors on an ergonomic backrest that give green signal if the user is sitting correctly, that is to say that his spine/back is correctly resting on the sensor points of the chair. This will nullify the use/need of a camera for this project.

Alas, these things still require time and my skills still need some amjor improvement for this to be made possible.

Do inform me or invite me to work on the project if you wish to take on the above suggestions and want to improve this in some way. I'll be most happy if you do.
